# 03-JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description

- This project was built to create an app that could create a randomly generated password. the page uses promps and confirms to select length of password and different characters included in the generated password. I learned about creating variables and pulling data from them along with the use of functions and for loops to make recursive processes automated.
